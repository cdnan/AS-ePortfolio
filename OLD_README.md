## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in political science at McMaster University. My research interests broadly include Canadian and comparative politics, elections, public opinion, financial governance and digital currencies. My doctoral research involves investigating the institutional and political dynamics of digital currency adoption.

I hold the position of Doctoral Fellow at McMaster University’s Digital Society Lab, where I am actively engaged in research at the intersection of technology, politics and finance. Within this research environment, I lead several projects that examine public attitudes toward digital currencies. I am also a 2025-2026 fellow with the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3).


## Projects

### 1. Understanding Canadian Attitudes Toward Cryptocurrency

Everyone has heard of cryptocurrency, but what do Canadians actually think about it? My research explored this question through original survey data collected across Ontario, Québec, and Alberta, uncovering a striking paradox: while awareness of digital currencies is nearly universal, actual ownership remains low and skepticism runs deep.

What makes this particularly interesting is the unexpected fault lines I discovered. Rather than simple left-right political divides, the real story is generational. Younger and older members of the same political parties hold dramatically different views on cryptocurrency. These generational rifts within party coalitions could reshape how Canada approaches fintech regulation in the years ahead.

This research provides a baseline of Canadian cryptocurrency attitudes and reveals why digital currencies, despite their ubiquity in financial news, continue struggling to gain public legitimacy. As policymakers grapple with how to regulate this space, understanding these public opinion dynamics becomes crucial.


### 2. The Impact of Framing and Elite Cues on Public Attitudes: The Case of Central Bank Digital Currencies

How susceptible is public opinion to various arguments on CBDCs? To what extent do elite cues on CBDCs affect public trust in the Bank of Canada to issue one? We know political messaging shapes public opinion, especially on complex topics where most people lack expertise. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) seemed like the perfect test case: a technical policy area where citizens should be particularly susceptible to guidance from trusted elites.

But my experimental research revealed something surprising: it doesn't always work that way. I designed a survey experiment (with my colleagues at the Digital Society Lab) exposing participants to different elite statements about CBDCs, from generic arguments to specific political endorsements. The theory was straightforward: positive frames should boost trust in the Bank of Canada to issue a digital currency, whereas negative frames would decrease trust. Instead, I found that most messaging fell flat, and political endorsements only moved the needle among partisans.

This matters because central banks worldwide are navigating increasingly politicized environments. If elite cues can't effectively build public support for technical monetary innovations, even in a "most likely" scenario with low public knowledge, it suggests the mechanisms of elite influence are more fragile than we thought. The findings challenge assumptions about how central bank legitimacy is built and sustained in an era of growing skepticism toward institutions.

### 3. CryptoCommons: Tracking Canada's Digital Currency Policy Debates

What do Canadian politicians have to say about cryptocurrency? Despite international conversations and debates about regulating digital currencies and blockchain technology, there's been no systematic way to track who's saying what in Parliament (unless you're willing to comb through Hansard Debates, that is).

I created [CryptoCommons.ca](https://cryptocommons.ca/), a public database that documents every statement Canadian politicians make about digital currencies in the House of Commons. By consolidating scattered legislative discourse into one searchable platform, CryptoCommons.ca empowers researchers, journalists and citizens to understand where politicians stand and how policy debates evolve.
