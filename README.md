I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in political science at McMaster University. My research interests broadly include Canadian and comparative politics, elections, public opinion, financial governance and digital currencies. My doctoral research involves investigating the institutional and political dynamics of digital currency adoption.

I hold the position of Doctoral Fellow at McMaster University’s Digital Society Lab, where I am actively engaged in research at the intersection of technology, politics and finance. Within this research environment, I lead several projects that examine public attitudes toward digital currencies. I am also a 2025-2026 fellow with the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3).


## Projects

<i>1. Understanding Canadian Attitudes Toward Cryptocurrency</i>

Everyone has heard of cryptocurrency, but how many Canadians actually trust it? My research explored this question through original survey data collected across Ontario, Québec, and Alberta, uncovering a striking paradox: while awareness of digital currencies is nearly universal, actual ownership remains low and skepticism runs deep.

What makes this particularly interesting is the unexpected fault lines I discovered. Rather than simple left-right political divides, the real story is generational. Younger and older members of the same political parties hold dramatically different views on cryptocurrency. These generational rifts within party coalitions could reshape how Canada approaches fintech regulation in the years ahead.

This research provides the first baseline of Canadian cryptocurrency attitudes and reveals why digital currencies, despite their ubiquity in financial news, continue struggling to gain public legitimacy. As policymakers grapple with how to regulate this space, understanding these public opinion dynamics becomes crucial.
