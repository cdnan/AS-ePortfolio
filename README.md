# Anwar Sheluchin

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in political science at McMaster University. My research interests broadly include Canadian and comparative politics, elections, public opinion, financial governance and digital currencies. My doctoral research involves investigating the institutional and political dynamics of digital currency adoption.

I hold the position of Doctoral Fellow at McMaster University’s Digital Society Lab, where I am actively engaged in research at the intersection of technology, politics and finance. Within this research environment, I lead several projects that examine public attitudes toward digital currencies. I am also a 2025-2026 fellow with the Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3).
